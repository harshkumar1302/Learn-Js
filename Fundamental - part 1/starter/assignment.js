// Coding Challenge 1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

const bmiOfJohn1 = weightJohn1 / (heightJohn1 ** 2);
console.log(`BMI of John is ${bmiOfJohn1}.`);
